### Fitness
All data and advice will be heavily researched and reguarly updated.
We will provide instructions on how to perform all activities and exercises to try to avoid injuries.
Workout plans will be created based upon the **_users goal questonaire_** compeleted by the user to generate a personal routine which best suits them.
Plans can also be created manualy by the user.
Sets, Reps and Rest times will be included to make sure the user completes a workout to a set level required to make progress.

### Dieting
Whether its to loose weight, put weight on or build muscle, our application will give advice such as:
- What types of food to eat
- How many meals to have throughout the day
- When to eat certain foods

- How much Fat, Protien, and Carbs should be eaten in each meal

All advice will be followed with examples and a mealplan will be automatically created based upon the **_users goal questionaire_**.

Advice will be given on how to get more motivation and how to perform mindfullness meditation techniques.
But we will also provide advice for some serious some mental health issues users may struggle with such as:
